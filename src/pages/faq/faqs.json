    {
      "question": "How do I book you?",
      "answer": "Once you choose a collection alongside any add ons, I will send over a contract. A signed contract and 50% retainer will reserve your wedding date. (This includes any travel cost, if applicable.) The remaining balance will be due 30 days prior to your wedding."

    },
    {
      "question": "How many photos can we expect from our wedding?",
      "answer": "You can expect anywhere from 50-100 images per hour. This all depends on the number of guests, adding on a second photographer, etc. I am happy to send over some full wedding galleries for your reference."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you take formal family portraits?",
      "answer": "Yes, yes and yes! As I shoot the majority of the day in a photo-journalistic approach, family portraits are important for every wedding. As the day approaches I will ask you to send over a list of family members in order to make the family portraits go smoothly. These typically take place post ceremony however, I recommend taking as many as you can pre-ceremony so you can enjoy the moment right after saying “I do!”"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we need to add on a second photographer?",
      "answer": "I shoot most weddings solo however if your guest count is over 150, when logistically It’d be impossible to have coverage in two places at once, or when you simply want extra coverage I would recommend adding on a second photographer."
