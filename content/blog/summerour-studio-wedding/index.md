Julia and Jackson's wedding day was such an honor to photograph. The love that both of their family and friends had for them was truly inspiring. It was a breath of fresh air to be around such a celebratory and caring community.

"The best part of the wedding for me was the overwhelming feeling of love and joy from everyone there. Weâ€™ve known all our lives that we have been given incredible families and friends, but seeing them interact with each other and lean in to celebrate our marriage together as one big family under Christ - it was electric and pure joy for us. Weddings ceremonies and celebrations are the perfect metaphor for new life. Everyone gets to witness the gravity of an unbreakable bond and join in the absolute party that is two coming together to help each other become who they were designed to be." - Julia
