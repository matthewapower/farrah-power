When I first talked with Sommer and JP they described wanting their wedding day to feel like “their favorite date they’ve ever had.” I love this perspective! You’re wedding day can be however you want it to be - there are no rules.

Sommer & JP were suppose to get married in March and with Covid19 happening, they had to make a change of plans and it turned out to be pretty magical. Married in their backyard surrounded by their family & close friends. Here’s how Sommer described it...

“Before we planned our big wedding we planned a small, intimate wedding in our yard. And by planned I mean we thought ‘we should get married here’ and then our guest list quickly outgrew the space so we went a different route. Two months later, and here we are: standing in our kitchen sous vide cooking steak on our wedding day. I love this man and I’m so thankful for all the work he and everyone else put into making this day happen.”
