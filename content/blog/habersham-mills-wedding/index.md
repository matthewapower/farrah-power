"The wedding day is likely the most magical, emotional and overwhelming day of your life. It also goes by the fastest. Savor every second. Don't stress about the small things, especially when it's too late to do anything about them. Remember why you planned the event- to celebrate your love with your future life partner. Make sure that you stay with them throughout the day. You may feel that you are hosting the party, but remember the party is also FOR you.  So, have fun, dance and appreciate the fact that everyone you love in your life is together in one place." -Allison

Everything about this day inspired me and it was a joy to photograph their story... I'll let the images speak for themselves on this one.
