It was the perfect fall day in November - the kind you dream of. Courtney and Andrew said I do in the front yard of a family friend's Victorian home. The reception was set under stringed lights as friends and loved ones told stories and many congratulations. Not to mention, they had their favorite pizza place cater dinner which is always a good move in my book.
