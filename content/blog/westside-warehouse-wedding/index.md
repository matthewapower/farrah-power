If you’re looking for an incredibly designed location in Atlanta for you and your bridesmaids to get ready at, look no further than Hotel Clermont. Claire and Gavin’s day was beautifully detailed but most importantly it was centered around the love these two have for each other and for their family and friends. It’s truly an honor to document moments that matter and photos that will get even better with time.
