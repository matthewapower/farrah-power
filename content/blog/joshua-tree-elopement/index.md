When Charly and Will reached out to me about photographing their elopement in Joshua Tree I was ecstatic! I love that they put their experience of the day as a priority before any checklist or timelines. They ended the day at sunset reading their vows to each other in the Cholla Cactus Garden. It was truly an honor to document their elopement in one of the most beautiful locations across the US. Everything about the way they described the day being resonated with me. She truly just wanted it to be a relaxed, intimate celebration of their love for each other. It was an absolute dream to document this day for two of the most kind people. I asked Charly what their favorite part of the day was and here's what she said:

“I think our favorite part of it all was how blissful and relaxing it was. There was no crazy schedule or trying to get a bunch of people ready at a certain time or to a certain place. We were able to soak up every moment together, which is the whole point. We wrote our vows the morning of, and I honestly melt every time I read over them, remembering exactly how the day felt. 
Every day we’ve had together the past 5 years led up to the most dreamy day, and we couldn’t have asked for anything more!”
